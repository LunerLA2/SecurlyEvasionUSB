# What is this?

This repo aims to provide information and methods to evade Securly, I am always searching for new bypasses so I will try to update this as frequently as possible. If i find a exploit and I have working ones I will not release them until the working one is patched, this is to prevent securly from patching my bypasses

## **Why?**

I believe that Securly is a violation of privacy. It imposes restrictions that can interfere with personal freedom and autonomy, monitoring internet activities and blocking access to various websites. This kind of surveillance can lead to a lack of trust, hinder free exploration and learning, and may violate individual rights to privacy. Users should have the ability to control their own internet experience without invasive monitoring. Therefore, this repo is designed to help users regain their digital autonomy by bypassing Securly's restrictions.
